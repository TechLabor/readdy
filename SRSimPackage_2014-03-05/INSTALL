 Building SRSim:
=================

Type 
   make prepare
and then
   make lmp_srsim
to build lammps with SRSim.



You will need an MPI implementation and the Xerces XML parser library for C++ installed on your machine.
If these libraries are not found in the standard search patch, you might have to modify
   RuleSys/Makefile
and
   lammpsCompilation/Makefile
.


When building was successful, you'll find a file lammpsCompilation/lmp_srsim which is the executable of SRSim.
You can link this file in your local binary directory.


When you're changing sources - especially the headers in RuleSys, you'll probably want to exchange 
the headers in RuleSys/SRSim/...  by symbolic links to the headers in the directory structure below.
This awkward step will have to be removed in the next versions.




Tricks to make the compilation work:
   - modify the open-mpi sources: 
       comment line 64 in /usr/include/mpi/openmpi/ompi/mpi/cxx/constants.h:
                    "// OMPI_DECLSPEC extern const int UNDEFINED;"
