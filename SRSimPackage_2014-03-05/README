This is the SRSim software packages.

It can be used for the spatial, rule-based simulation of (biochemical) 
reaction networks.

Please have a look at the docs/readme docs/manual.pdf files to guide
you through the installation and use of SRSim.

SRSim is based upon the sources of the molecular dynamics simulator 
LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov/). The original functionality of 
LAMMPS is not altered, so the new modules should be compatible with 
the original lammps sources as well.

Please let us know if you use the software. Please send comments and 
critics to 'MrWowbagger at gmx.net'.
