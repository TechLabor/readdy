 Version History:
 
 2.0 : can do dihedral angles
       can export a value corresponding to the state of a site modification
       
 2.01b: can now implement exchange rules... changing the number of molecules per rules!
 
 2.02: some bug fixes
 
 2.03: fixed two bugs from 2.02:
        - bngl files with tabs around modifiers were parsed wrongly.
        - we didn't update the templates far enough in graphs - now set the update distance
          to maxReactiveTemplateSize() + 1
          
 2.04: - added a new dump_bonds module, so that we can plot the realized bonds in a network
       - killed a bug, SRSim crashes when running multiple runs - LammpsMolecule didn't tidy up correctly.
          
 2.05: - killed one more bug about dihedral angles (hopefully)
       - added support for dump bonds (BNGL_GRAPHS|BOND_SET) so that we 
         can output the graph of species residing in the reactor in 
         the form of a BNGL string.
       - examples/002 was changed - hopefully working again, now.
 
 2.06: - re-added support for writing/reading restart files!
 
 2.07: - support for dump_rea (writes reaction network)
